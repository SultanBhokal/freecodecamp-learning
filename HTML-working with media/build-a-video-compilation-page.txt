        <h1>Web development</h1>
        <p>It is divided into two main parts: front-end and back-end development. Front-end development focuses on the visual and interactive aspects of a website or application. It involves designing the user interface (UI), enhancing user experience (UX), and managing media elements. The goal is to create a user-friendly interface, typically using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Back-end development, on the other hand, deals with the server side. It involves implementing business logic, managing databases, and delivering raw or processed data—including real-time information—to the front end.</p>
